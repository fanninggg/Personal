This means that websites designed without mobile and tablet users in mind will be excluding over half of their potential audience. As such, my goal is to provide for this preponderant group first, ensuring that there is no loss of functionality or design as a result of varied device usage.</p>

      <p id="line-height">I am a 23 year old full-stack <b class="bold">developer</b> with a passion for <b class="bold">front-end design</b>. I grew up in Surrey and lived there for the first 18 years of my life before moving to Plymouth to study Politics and International Relations for 3 years. Post graduation I travelled to the Canadian Rockies where I lived for a couple of years working as a ski Instructor at Mt. Norquay in Banff.
      <br>
      <br>
      I decided to move back to London in late 2017 in order to pursue a career in tech. Having started to teach myself <b class="bold">Ruby</b> and <b class="bold">Javascript</b> with some online courses I took the decision to accelerate my learning and joined Le Wagon's intensive nine-week coding bootcamp. During the course of this programme my team designed <%= link_to "voyagr.co.uk", "https://www.voyagr.co.uk/", target: "_blank", class: "voyagr" %>, a facebook chatbot which provides personalised travel suggestions, this gave me valuable experience designing mobile first web pages.
      <br>
      <br>
      Following the bootcamp I was asked to return as a teaching assistant for the next batch of students, this has allowed me to consolidate my knowledge as well as providing me with the opportunity of <b class="bold">debugging</b> code written in a variety of different styles.
      <br>
      <br>
      Away from tech, my main passions include skiing/snowboarding, sailing, skating and struggling to surf.</p>
